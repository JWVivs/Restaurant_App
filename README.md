# Restaurant_App
Capstone project: Creating an app that generates a map of restaurants in certain cities, and features a Latent Dirichlet allocation model that uses spectral initilization in order to assess which restaurants are most similar to those that a business is currently supplying. Ideally, this will help improve sales efficiency by targeting restaurants that are likely to purchase the business' product.
